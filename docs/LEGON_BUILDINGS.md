# Legon buildings: modelled from reference photos

LEGONRUSH draws every building footprint with one generic builder (`src/game/facades.ts`): cream walls
tiled with window bays, a plinth and a terracotta roof, with the height taken from the master geography.
Buildings are now being rebuilt **one group at a time** to match how they really look, with their real
height, entrances, windows and roof. A modelled building keeps its mapped footprint (routing, collisions and
the map still use it), the generic builder skips it, and its model is placed on the footprint.

| Step | Buildings | Model | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | The Diaspora halls: Dr. Hilla Limann, Alexander Kwapong, Elizabeth Frances Sey, Jean Nelson Aka | `src/game/halls.ts` | owner photos (5) and description |

## 1. The Diaspora halls

All four halls are one design. Each is built on its OSM footprint (confirmed by Google Open Buildings,
157 m × 79 m, courtyard 126 m × 45 m); only the orientation differs.

**Arrangement** (from the owner): the halls stand in a row in two facing pairs. Coming in from Jubilee Link,
**Dr. Hilla Limann** is the first hall; it faces **Alexander Kwapong**. Their front entrances face each other
across their car parks. Past a playing field, **Elizabeth Frances Sey** and **Jean Nelson Aka** face each other
the same way. Every hall also has a **back entrance**, on the opposite facade, with no car park.

**What the model has** (matched to the photos):

- **Height:** four storeys (ground + three), 3.15 m each on a 0.45 m plinth, a plain eave band, walls 13.5 m,
  roof ridge 18.2 m. The master geography now records 4 levels / 18 m for all four
  (`registry/corrections.json → heights`; OSM had Limann as 3 levels, the others were estimated).
- **Plan:** a closed quadrangle round a courtyard; wings 15-17 m deep (from the mapped courtyard ring).
- **Roof:** terracotta tiles, hipped at the outer corners, valleys round the courtyard, white fascia boards
  and soffits on both eaves.
- **Entrance pavilions** at the centre of both long facades (front and back are the same, as in the
  photos): a 10 m wide block standing 2.2 m forward of the facade, a front-facing gable with a white
  pediment and rake boards, a tall round-headed window over the top floors with bronze mullions and
  transoms, small flanking windows, a string course, and a porch: four slim white columns, a flat canopy
  with the hall's name, glass doors in bronze frames, a platform and two steps.
- **Facades:** white render; upper floors are recessed balconies behind solid white parapets with
  timber-framed windows at the back, between white piers and slab bands; the ground floor has dark timber
  louvred windows; the ends of the long facades are plain white. At night the windows and lobbies light up.
- **Stair towers:** white shafts with open stairwells (dark slots crossed by landing slabs) on the outer
  long facades and behind each pavilion on the courtyard side, rising through the eaves with two black
  water tanks on top; tank stands on the side-wing ridges; open stairwells on the courtyard faces.
- **Courtyard:** paving with planting along the walls and lawns, the portal-to-portal walk and a cross
  walk, a round fountain plaza in the middle, a teal volleyball court on one side and a green basketball
  court (red centre circle and keys, hoops) on the other, and trees.
- **Car parks** in front of each hall (OSM). The two OSM "car parks" behind Limann and Kwapong are drawn as
  paved forecourts (`registry/corrections.json → reclass`), since the back entrances have no car park.

**Entrances in the data:** see [LEGON_ENTRANCE_VERIFICATION.md](LEGON_ENTRANCE_VERIFICATION.md). The front
door is the middle of the facade facing the partner hall (`faces`), the back door the middle of the opposite
facade (`awayFrom`); `/geo/` shows both (open *Destination entrances* and pick a hall). Rides end at the front
door.

**Kept clear:** the courtyards, porches and stair towers are kept free of generated trees, hedges, benches
and people (`inDiasporaHall` in `life.ts`).

**Cost:** each hall is five meshes (window walls, plain render and trim, roof, glass, courtyard) plus two
sign planes; the four halls share one set of geometry, and each mesh is skipped beyond the fog like the
other buildings.

**Not modelled yet / open points**

- The swimming pool the aerial shows in one courtyard, and the exact layout of planting and paths in each
  courtyard (all four use the same layout).
- The paved walkway across the car parks between facing portals.
- Window counts per bay are approximated (a 3.6 m bay).
