// NSIA Road by the Frank Torto Chemistry Building: the calibration values the reconstruction brief asks to keep
// adjustable (the owner's NSIA Road reconstruction brief, six game/photo pairs and an overhead map). Nothing here is
// surveyed: the photos give relative levels and local edges, not elevations, distances or the road's grade. The terrain
// (relief.ts), the walls, drain, trees and ground cover (nsiaroad.ts), the route's plain stretch (world.ts) and the six
// comparison cameras (tools/preview) all read these numbers, so one change keeps the views consistent.
//
// The map (image 13) matched to the game: NSIA Road runs north-south at x 235 from J.K.M. Hodasi Road (z -162) to the
// Danquah Avenue roundabout (z 115); the Chemistry complex lies west of it (the Frank Torto Building, its car park,
// the chemistry ranges), the cross-shaped Home Science Annex east of it in the north, LECIAD east of it further south.
// Between NSIA Road and the chemistry buildings runs the narrow lane (the "lower corridor", x 210), with the tree belt
// between the lane and NSIA Road; the short connecting road at z -26 joins them.
