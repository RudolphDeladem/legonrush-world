# LEGONRUSH

**The Campus Lifestyle Reimagined. Ride. Race. Connect.**

A browser-based 3D cycling game set on the University of Ghana, Legon campus, delivered as an installable Progressive Web App (PWA). This repository holds the MVP prototype (phase 1 of the product spec).

## Site

- `/` is the landing page (DELA's design and logo)
- `/play/` is the game; every "Get started" button leads there, and the installed app opens straight into it

## What's playable now

- Splash → Welcome → Create Rider (name, username, hall) → Choose Starter Bike → tutorial first ride → Results → Home
- Guest play (skip sign-up, create a rider later)
- **The real campus from OpenStreetMap**: every road and footpath, 1,600 building footprints at their real positions and sizes, pitches, parking and water, and 400+ named places
- **Explore**: pick where you are and where you need to be (for example Limann Hall to the School of Law or Pent), see the real shortest way on a map with distance, walking and cycling time and turn-by-turn directions, then ride it with a direction banner, place labels and a heading-up mini map. Built so freshers can learn their way around. Routes can be shared as a link (or on WhatsApp) and opened in Google Maps; each destination gets a card with what it is, what is nearby and the nearest trotro stop.
- **Freshers' Tour**: one 3.5 km ride past Night Market, Central Cafeteria, JQB, the Balme Library, the Business School, the Registry and the Great Hall
- **Where is it?**: five campus places, tap the map where you think each one is, earn coins
- First-draft landmark models: the Balme Library clock tower, the Great Hall tower, the main gate and the Night Market stalls
- **Quick Ride, Limann to Great Hall (2.6 km)**: 3-lane arcade runner on the real roads with cars, trotros, pedestrians, barriers and potholes, Rush Coins, a boost meter, score, distance, finish line and results
- Real halls of residence to represent; jersey colour follows your hall
- Home hub, Ride, Race (coming soon), Events (coming soon) and You (profile + stats)
- Progress, coins, XP and levels saved on the device
- Installable and works offline after the first load

## Controls

| | Keyboard | Touch |
|---|---|---|
| Change lane | ← → or A D | Swipe left / right |
| Jump | ↑, W or Space | Swipe up |
| Boost | B or Shift | Tap, or the Boost button |
| Pause | Esc or P | Pause button |

Jump over barriers and potholes. Dodge cars, trotros and pedestrians. Potholes slow you down; everything else ends the ride, unless you are boosting.

## Run it

```bash
npm install
npm run dev        # http://localhost:5173 (also on your LAN for testing on a phone)
npm run build      # typecheck + production build in dist/
npm run preview    # serve the production build (PWA/service worker active)
```

Deploys to Netlify from `main` using `netlify.toml` (build `npm run build`, publish `dist`).

Requires Node 20+.

## The campus map

The campus geography is rebuilt from several independent sources and documented in [docs/LEGON_MASTER_GEOGRAPHY.md](docs/LEGON_MASTER_GEOGRAPHY.md): OpenStreetMap (`data/legon.osm` plus OSM features outside that extract via Overture Maps), Google Open Buildings and Microsoft ML footprints, Overture places, the [UG Campus Map](https://enkayyy97.github.io/ug-campus-map/) by enkayyy97, ESA WorldCover, the Copernicus DEM, a Sentinel-2 composite and the curated registries in `data/geography/registry/`. `npm run geo` builds the authoritative dataset (`data/geography/legon-master.geojson`, with a reconciliation report) and then the game's `src/data/legon-map.json`. `scripts/geography/fetch_sources.py` refreshes the source snapshots. Open `/geo/` on the dev server or the live site to compare the map with satellite imagery from above. Missing or misplaced buildings are best fixed on OpenStreetMap itself, which also helps everyone else.

## Roadmap (from the product spec)

1. **MVP** (this repo): one zone, one bike class, solo Quick Ride, score, results, basic profile
2. Multiple routes, real campus layout, garage and bikes, accounts (Supabase), leaderboards
3. 10-player real-time races, private rooms with codes, social riding
4. Events, hall competitions, Together mode, live population
5. Vehicles, economy expansion, in-world brand billboards and sponsored events
